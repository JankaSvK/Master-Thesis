% Searching Image Collections Using Deep Representations of Local Regions

% The thesis will investigate two particular approaches for searching large video datasets. The first approach will try to retrieve a searched scene based on a query collage consisting of example images organized on a canvas. The author will investigate various fusion methods, taking into account also the canvas positioning of the query images.  The second approach will be designed to search for a scene based on faces available in the dataset. The method will be based on visual exploration of the faces based on their similarities. In exploration approaches, the user can choose a similar face to the searched one, and continuously browse towards the searched face. The author will provide an interactive search environment for querying as a part of the solution and evaluate the recall on sets of experiments to estimate, how successfully users can retrieve particular scenes.
