In the last decades, we have witnessed a massive jump in the amount of digital information owned by individuals. Looking back 20-30 years, people used to record only a few hours of their lives, capturing precious moments. Now, according to available estimates, more than 500 hours of videos is uploaded every minute  to YouTube\footnote{\href{https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute/}{Statista -- Hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute}} only. Furthermore, decreasing prices and increasing availability of the recording electronics (especially smartphones) contribute to the amount of multimedia data created every day. It has also become a trend to share videos from day-to-day lives.

The significant increase in the volume of multimedia data opens several new challenges. One of the most vital is the need for effective search and retrieval. This problem is not only attractive to researchers, but the initiative also comes from the industry. Companies try to help their customers to organize a vast amount of multimedia data (Google Photos, Facebook, OneDrive, MEGA, and others). Those companies often rely on a broad spectrum of techniques used to store and organize the data internally. Unfortunately, users are usually provided with only the most straightforward technique to filter the data.

Besides attempting to overcome the challenges of querying large volumes of stored data, we will focus on a challenging scenario in which a user searches for one given image in a dataset. This task of searching for a previously seen multimedia object is often referred to as visual known-item search (KIS). In this thesis, we investigate several known-item search techniques where users provide a few example images as a collage query or browse through images of faces organized in a grid with respect to their similarity.

Known-item search has become a well-known research area \citep{8352047}. According to recent findings \citep{9037125}, most of the known-item search engines incorporate both querying and interactive search functionality. In order to elevate the level of developed KIS systems, researchers organize and participate in annual competitions. These efforts help to increase the interest in user-centered multimedia search. One, for example, is Video Browser Showdown\footnote{\url{https://videobrowsershowdown.org/}}, or shortly VBS. For a comparison, TRECVid \citep{2019trecvidawad} is also an annual competition with the main focus on ranking of scenes based on a textual description.

In this thesis, we investigate a couple of approaches to solve the known-item search task:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Searching by an image collage query.
  \item Searching by browsing in a set of faces from the dataset.
\end{enumerate}

In the first approach, we focus on searching known images via only example images and their approximate position in the searched image. Users can create a collage of images that reminds them of the searched scene and then browse through the ranked result list looking for the match.

The second approach is an experimental test of the possibility of visual traversing through a dataset of faces. To present a user with a feasible amount of faces in one display, we tackle this challenge by organizing the faces into multilevel view supporting navigational queries. We implemented the traversal system, although we found out that this technique is less effective than other retrieval techniques presented in this thesis.

The goal of this thesis is to create a framework to test both approaches, as mentioned earlier. We aim to create a novice-friendly interface for smooth user-system interaction.

For the techniques which searching by the collages, We provide evaluations on an annotated set of queries. We manually created a set of collages, as our queries. We use them to test different hyperparameters of the proposed system. We evaluate the proposed methods based on the rank of the target image. Well-performing methods bring the searched items to the foreground, placing them at the top ranks.

We evaluate the second approach -- search based on faces -- with the help of a case study. We firstly investigate the space of the feature vectors by evaluating the responses from the survey. Then we present the solution. In the end, we provide a comparison between the average time needed to find a target face. We compare our traversal system to a display of randomly ordered faces.

\subsubsection*{Thesis structure}
The thesis is divided into four main chapters. After the Introduction, we continue by reviewing Related Work (\autoref{ch:related_work}) and Content-based image retrieval (\autoref{ch:preliminaries}). Related Work previews several existing frameworks for solving the KIS task. Content-based image retrieval chapter contains some elementary theoretical background for CBIR tasks and also evaluation settings.

After these introductory chapters, we present investigated approaches in chapters \ref{ch:content_based}, \ref{ch:object_location} and \ref{ch:face_search}. \todo{ref}

The end of the thesis is dedicated to the implementation of the aforementioned approaches. This includes the user's guide -- how to interact with the system, and developer's guide -- how to modify the dataset or how to incorporate a new approaches.

In summary, we designed and successfully tested a promising approach based on collage queries. The most promising approach splits images into multiple parts. We also developed a traversal system for previewing a dataset of faces. The experiments show, that using it decreased time of the individual search by XX\% \todo{}.
