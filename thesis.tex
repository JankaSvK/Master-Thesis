% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
In a known-item search task (KIS), the goal is to find a previously seen image in a multimedia collection. In this thesis, we discuss two different approaches based on the visual description of the image.

In the first one, the user creates a collage of images (using images from an external search engine), based on which we provide the most similar results from the dataset. Our experiments show that we can provide more relevant results when incorporating spatial information by splitting the images into several parts. We compared this approach to a baseline, which does not utilize this spatial information and an approach that alters a layer in a deep neural network.

We also present an alternative approach to the KIS task, search by faces. In this approach, we work with the faces extracted from the images. We investigate face representations for their ability to sort people based on their similarity. Based on these similarities, we build a structure that allows easy exploration of the set of faces.

We provide a demo, implementing all presented techniques.
