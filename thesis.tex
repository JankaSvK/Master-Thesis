% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
In a known-item-search task, the goal is to find a previously seen scene/image in a bigger multimedia collection. We aim to present techniques to solve a specific alternation of this task -- searching for a memorized image, which was previously seen. We test two different approaches in this thesis. The first one incorporates visual descriptions of the objects in the searched image (for example, using example images from common image search engines) together with their spatial information (wherein the image is the object located). The second approach tackles this known-item-search task by extracting only faces of the people in the dataset, and we investigate a browsing system for the faces. This thesis includes evaluations of both approaches and also a working software to test all presented approaches.
